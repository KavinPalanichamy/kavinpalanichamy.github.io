Additionally, I developed multi-threaded Python scripts to automate a proprietary robotic textile handling system and created a custom Python library for SMC rotary and Pololu drives, successfully integrating it into the operational cycle.","highlights":["Python","Electronics and Instrumentation","3D Printing","Autodesk Inventor","Automation"]},{"name":"PIAP Lukasiewicz","location":"Warsaw, Poland","position":"Junior Specialist - Programmer","url":"https://www.piap.pl/en/","startDate":"2023-10-01","endDate":"2023-12-31","summary":"During my internship, I developed a UWB-based indoor positioning system that enabled precise location tracking in environments with high signal interference. I programmed Qorvo's UWB modules to function as anchors or tags and created a Raspberry Pi application to convert UWB signals into readable coordinates. The system transmitted data in NMEA format for mapping and calculated local to global coordinates using the Haversine formula. It seamlessly switched between GNSS and UWB modes, defaulting to GNSS but transitioning to UWB when necessary. Testing confirmed reliable indoor navigation with UWB and effective GNSS functionality outdoors.","highlights":["C++","Raspberry Pi","Mobile Robotics"]}],"education":[{"institution":"Warsaw University of Technology","location":"Warsaw, Poland","url":"https://www.pw.edu.pl/en","area":"Mechatronics Engineering","studyType":"Undergraduate Degree","startDate":"2021-01-10","endDate":"2025-02-10","score":"4.42/5.0","areas of study":["Control Systems","Electronics","Embedded Programming","Mechanical Design & Prototyping"]},{"institution":"Technical University of Munich","location":"Munich, Germany","url":"https://www.tum.de/en/","area":"Mechatronics, Robotics and Bio-Mechanical Engineering","studyType":"Master's Degree","startDate":"2025-04-01","endDate":"Ongoing","score":"N/A","areas of study":["Deep Learning","Bio-Robotics","Advanced Control Systems","Computer Vision"]}],"scholarships":[{"title":"Erasmus Grant","date":"2024-02-10","awarder":"Warsaw University of Technology"}],"certificates":[{"name":"Machine Learning","date":"2018-01-01","issuer":"Stanford University","url":"https://example.com","icon":"fa-solid fa-location-dot"}],"publications":[{"name":"Zur Elektrody/namik bewegter Körper","publisher":"Annalen der Physik","releaseDate":"1905-06-30","url":"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:On_the_Electrodynamics_of_Moving_Bodies","summary":"It concerned an interpretation of the Michelson–Morley experiment and the properties of light and time.
