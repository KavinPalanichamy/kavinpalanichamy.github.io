In this project at Desion, our team designed and prototyped a robotic gripper designed specifically for lifting and handling soft cloth materials without causing damage. The project focused on iterative prototyping using 3D printing to achieve optimal control and delicacy in grasping.

Key highlights of the project include:

- Development of a gentle grip mechanism suitable for soft and pliable materials
- Precision prototyping with Autodesk Inventor and 3D printing for functional testing
- Optimization of grip strength and pressure control
