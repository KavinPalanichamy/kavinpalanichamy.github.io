## System Overview

The AI-powered animal detection system addresses the challenge of identifying and locating specific animals in complex natural scenes using intuitive natural language descriptions. Instead of requiring users to know exact taxonomic names, the system accepts descriptive prompts like "King of the jungle" or "Fastest land animal" and intelligently matches them to detected animals.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Intelligent Segmentation:** Uses SAM to precisely segment individual objects in images
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Accepts descriptive prompts for animal identification
- **High-Precision Classification:** Employs CLIP for robust animal classification across 12 species
- **Spatial Localization:** Provides detailed coordinate information for detected animals
- **Visual Feedback:** Generates annotated output images with bounding boxes and labels

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

**1. Segment Anything Model (SAM)**

- **Model:** ViT-H (Huge variant) for maximum accuracy
- **Function:** Generates high-quality object masks without class-specific training
- **Optimization:** Configured with adaptive parameters to reduce over-segmentation
- **Performance:** Processes images with 32 seed points per side for comprehensive coverage

**2. CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)**

- **Model:** ViT-L-14 for superior visual-semantic understanding
- **Function:** Classifies segmented objects and matches natural language prompts
- **Classes:** Supports 12 animal categories (zebra, giraffe, camel, moose, tiger, bear, cheetah, lion, gorilla, rhino, hippo, elephant)
- **Confidence Filtering:** Implements 30% confidence threshold for reliable detections

**3. Advanced Processing Pipeline**

- **Image Preprocessing:** OpenCV-based image loading and color space conversion
- **Mask Filtering:** Multi-criteria filtering based on area, stability, and IoU scores
- **Coordinate Extraction:** Precise centroid and bounding box calculations
- **Visual Overlay:** PIL-based annotation with color-coded labels and coordinates

### Processing Workflow

```python
# Simplified workflow representation
1. Load input image → Image preprocessing
2. Generate object masks → SAM segmentation
3. Filter high-quality masks → Quality assessment
4. Extract object crops → Bounding box extraction
5. Classify each crop → CLIP classification
6. Match user prompt → Semantic matching
7. Generate output visualization → Result overlay
```

## Implementation Features

### Smart Segmentation Parameters

The system employs optimized SAM parameters to balance detection accuracy with processing efficiency:

- **Points per side:** 32 seed points for comprehensive coverage
- **IoU threshold:** 0.90 for high-quality mask selection
- **Stability score:** 0.97 for consistent object boundaries
- **Minimum area:** 10,000 pixels to filter noise
- **Maximum segments:** Limited to 15 top-quality masks

### Confidence-Based Filtering

Only detections exceeding the confidence threshold are considered valid, ensuring reliable results:

- **Primary threshold:** 30% confidence minimum
- **Area filtering:** Minimum 3,000 pixels for object significance
- **Stability requirements:** High stability scores for consistent detection
- **Non-maximum suppression:** Eliminates overlapping detections
