This project explores the design, construction, and control of a ball-on-plate (BPS) balancing system.  The system utilizes a 3RRS (Revolute-Revolute-Spherical) parallel manipulator as the platform, a resistive touch screen for ball position feedback, and a PID controller to achieve stable balancing and trajectory tracking. The project also includes a detailed Simulink model for simulation, analysis, and controller tuning.

## System Overview

The ball-on-plate system is a classic control problem, known for its inherent instability and multivariable nature. This project aims to:

*   **Design and Build:** Construct a functional BPS using a 3RRS parallel manipulator.
*   **Implement Control:** Achieve stable ball balancing using a PID controller.
*   **Simulate the System:** Develop a Simulink model to simulate the BPS dynamics for analysis and tuning.
*   **Trajectory Tracking:** Implement software to enable the ball to trace predefined trajectories (circles, infinity symbols, squares).

This project demonstrates the application of control theory, mechatronics, and simulation techniques to a challenging real-world problem.

## Hardware Components

The system consists of the following key hardware components:

*   **3RRS Parallel Manipulator:** Provides the platform for balancing the ball.  This particular design offers good precision and control flexibility.
*   **Resistive Touchscreen:**  Senses the ball's position on the plate. A cost-effective and readily available solution for position feedback.
*   **Stepper Motors (NEMA 17) with TMC2209 Drivers:** Actuate the platform, precisely adjusting its tilt to maintain balance. The TMC2209 drivers provide smooth, quiet operation.
*   **Maker Uno Microcontroller (Arduino Compatible):**  Controls the system, reads sensor data, implements the PID algorithm, and drives the stepper motors.
*   **CNC Shield:** Provides a convenient and organized interface for connecting the stepper motor drivers and other components to the microcontroller.
*   **Power Supply:** Provides the necessary power for the stepper motors and microcontroller.
*   **3D Printed Parts:** Custom designed and 3D printed mechanical components for the platform and linkages.

## Software and Control Algorithm

The software implementation includes:

*   **Arduino Firmware:**  The core control software written in C++ for the Maker Uno. It handles sensor input, PID calculations, inverse kinematics, and motor control.
*   **PID Controller:**  A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is used to stabilize the ball's position. The controller calculates the necessary platform tilt based on the error between the ball's actual and desired positions.
*   **Inverse Kinematics:**  A set of equations that translate the desired platform tilt (represented as a normal vector) into specific motor angles for the 3RRS manipulator.
*   **Touchscreen Input Handling:** Reads the raw X and Y coordinates from the touch screen and converts them into meaningful position data.  Includes scaling and offset correction.

## Simulink Model

A detailed Simulink model was created to:

*   **Simulate BPS Dynamics:** Model the ball's motion on the plate using Lagrangian mechanics.
*   **Analyze System Behavior:**  Investigate the system's response to different inputs and disturbances.
*   **Tune the PID Controller:**  Optimize the PID gains before implementing them on the physical system.
*   **Create a Digital Twin:** To provide theoretical predictions about the system's response

## Results and Performance

The physical system was successfully assembled and balanced, achieving stable control of the ball.

**Key Metrics:**

*   **Stability:** The system is able to maintain the ball within a reasonable area around the setpoint.
*   **Settling Time:** The time it takes for the ball to settle near the setpoint after a disturbance was around 3.8 seconds.
*   **Steady-State Error:**A slight steady-state error of approximately 25mm was observed primarily due to inherent biases of the system.
*   **Trajectory Tracking:** The system was able to track predefined trajectories, including circles, infinity symbols, and squares

*   **Mitigating Jitter:** Implementing filtering techniques to reduce noise from the touch screen input and improve stability.
*   **Advanced Control Strategies:** Exploring more advanced control algorithms like Model Predictive Control (MPC) or Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) to achieve better performance.
*   **Hardware Optimization:** Improving the mechanical design to reduce friction and backlash, and exploring higher-resolution sensors.

## Conclusion

The system achieved stable balancing and trajectory tracking using a PID controller and a Simulink model for simulation and tuning. Further improvements in control algorithms and hardware design could lead to even better performance.
