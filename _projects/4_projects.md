## Hackathon Pitch - WaveSense

In February 2023, our team participated in Hackvision, a hackathon hosted in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA). The event aimed to encourage the utilization of open-source satellite data for innovative solutions.

Our pitch for WaveSense leveraged elevation profiles to assess signal strength in specific regions. This novel approach:

- Utilized open-source satellite data to enhance positioning accuracy
- Improved signal strength prediction in varied terrains

Our pitch secured victory in the initial stage of the hackathon and earned recognition in the finals, highlighting the potential of open source satellite data.
