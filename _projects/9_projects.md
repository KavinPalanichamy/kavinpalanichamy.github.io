### System Architecture

The SafePath navigation system addresses the critical need for accessible and affordable navigation tools through a multi-modal approach combining visual, tactile, and auditory feedback mechanisms. Current navigation solutions for visually impaired individuals are often expensive and inaccessible, creating a significant gap in mobility assistance technology.

### Technical Implementation

The SafePath system integrates multiple advanced technologies:

- **Computer vision processing** with real-time environment scanning and object detection
- **Multi-modal haptic feedback** using precision vibration alerts for spatial awareness
- **AI-powered natural language processing** for contextual voice descriptions of surroundings
- **Open-source architecture** enabling community development and continuous improvement

### Research & Validation

To ensure our solution addressed real needs, we conducted **over 30 in-depth interviews** with members of the visually-impaired community. This user-centered approach validated our design decisions and helped us create a truly useful product.
