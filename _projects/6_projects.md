## Project Overview - T3S

_T3S_ is an advanced automation concept for the textile industry, focusing on efficient handling and quality assurance. By combining automated fabric manipulation with AI-driven defect detection, T3S aims to streamline the inspection and sorting process, ensuring high-quality standards with reduced manual intervention.

Key features of the T3S system:

- **Automated Fabric Handling:** Linear Guides and grippers designed for careful manipulation of textiles, minimizing damage and wrinkles during sorting and transport.
- **AI-Enabled Defect Detection:** Machine learning models trained to identify common textile defects, such as tears, discolorations, and inconsistencies in weave patterns, in real time.
- **Enhanced Quality Control:** Real-time feedback loop allows immediate sorting and rejection of defective materials, improving throughput and reducing waste.
- **Scalability for Diverse Textiles:** Configurable to accommodate a wide range of fabrics and materials, from delicate silks to rugged denims.

Through T3S, the textile industry can benefit from a more consistent, precise, and reliable quality control process, driven by cutting-edge automation and artificial intelligence.
