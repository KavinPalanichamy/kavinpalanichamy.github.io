Hi, I’m a **Mechatronics Engineer** with a passion for building **smart machines** that blend robotics, automation, and AI.

I earned my bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics from [Warsaw University of Technology](https://www.pw.edu.pl/) and am now pursuing a **master’s in Mechatronics, Robotics, and Bio-Mechanical Engineering** at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/).

My studies among other things primarily focus on **humanoid robot development** ,exploring advanced control systems, biomechanics, and AI-driven motion.

I setup this website primarily to create a [project portfolio](https://www.kavinp.xyz/projects/) and also as a fun way to experiment with web hosting and development.

If you're into robotics, automation, or innovative mechatronic solutions, let’s connect and exchange ideas!
