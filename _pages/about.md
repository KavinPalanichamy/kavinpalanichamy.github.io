Hi, I’m a **Robotics Engineer** with a passion for building **Intelligent machines** that can navigate and interact with our surroundings. 

I earned my bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics from [Warsaw University of Technology](https://www.pw.edu.pl/) and am now pursuing a **master’s in Mechatronics, Robotics, and Bio-Mechanical Engineering** at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/).

I setup this website primarily to create a [project portfolio](https://www.kavinp.xyz/projects/) and also as a fun way to experiment with web hosting and development.
